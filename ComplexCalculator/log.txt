Addition: 5.0 + 2.0i and 1.0 + 3.0i = 6.0 + 5.0i
Multiplication: 5.0 + 2.0i and 1.0 + 3.0i = -1.0 + 17.0i
Division: 5.0 + 2.0i and 1.0 + 3.0i = 1.1 - 1.3i
Addition: 5.0 + 2.0i and 1.0 + 3.0i = 6.0 + 5.0i
Addition: 58.0 + 2.0i and 36.0 + 5.0i = 94.0 + 7.0i
Multiplication: 58.0 + 2.0i and 36.0 + 5.0i = 2078.0 + 362.0i
Division: 58.0 + 2.0i and 36.0 + 5.0i = 1.5881907645722937 - 0.16502649507948525i
